## DARP Instances

### Instance generation

As described by Cordeau et al. (2016), in an instance with $n$ users, where n is even, users $1, \dots, n/2$ are assumed to formulate outbound requests while users $n/2+1,\dots n$ formulate inbound requests.
In all instances, the coordinates of pick-up and drop-off nodes are randomly and independently chosen in the square $[-10,10] \times [−10,10]$ according to a uniform distribution, and the depot is located at the center of this square.
For every arc $(v_i,v_j) \in A$, the routing cost $c_{ij}$ and travel time $t_{ij}$ are equal to the Euclidean distance between the two nodes.

A time window $[e_i, l_i]$ is also associated with each node.
For an outbound user $i$, a time window was generated by first choosing a number $l_{n+i}$ in the interval $[0, T-60]$ and then setting $e_{n+i} = l_{n+i} − 15$, where $T$ denotes the length of the planning horizon.
For an inbound user, the value of $e_i$ was chosen in the interval $[0, T − 60]$ and the value of $l_i$ was set equal to $e_i + 15$.
Time windows on the origin nodes of outbound requests and on the destination nodes of inbound requests are set as explained in §5.

In the first set of instances, $Q = 3$ for every vehicle, $q_i=1$ and $d_i = 3$ for every user, and the maximum ride time $L$ is equal to 30 minutes.
In the second set, $Q = 6$ for every vehicle and the values of $q_i$ are chosen randomly according to a uniform distribution on the set  $\{1, \dots, Q\}$.
The maximum ride time is set equal to $45$ minutes. In this case, we assume that service time is proportional to the number of passengers and $d_i = q_i$.
The maximum route duration is equal to $T$.
The first set of instances represents the context where cars are used for the transportation of individuals whereas the second set reflects the situation of a transporter using mini-busses for the transportation of individuals or groups of individuals.

The first line `2 16 480 3 30` features, in turn:

- $|K|$: number of vehicles (`2`),
- $|P|$: number of customers (`16`),
- $T$: maximum route duration (`480`),
- $|Q|$: vehicle capacity (`3`),
- $L$: maximum ride time (`30`).

The subsequent lines comprise the columns:

- node id ($i \in N$),

The second line `0   0.000   0.000   0   0    0  480` corresponds to the depot data.

Hence,  for example, passenger $i=1$:

- shall be picked up at node $1 \in P$ with load $q_1 = 1$,
- shall be picked up point $(x,y)=(-1.198, -5.164)$,
- shall be picked up within time window $(e_1, l_1) = (0, 1440)$,
- takes a pickup service duration $d_1=3$.

Later, passenger $1$:

- shall be delivered at node $n+i = 17$ with load $q_{17} = -1$ (i.e., $q_{17} = -q_1$),
- shall be delivered at point $(x,y)=(6.687, 6.731)$,
- shall be delivered within time window $(e_{17}, l_{17}) = (402, 417)$,
- takes a delivery service duration $d_{17}=3$.

### Static vs. dynamic problems

A 'static' vehicle routing problem is the traditional academic problem where jobs and drivers are 100% known prior to the delivery period starting, and a single plan can therefore be generated at the start of the period.


## Solver SCIP

What is SCIP? <https://www.scipopt.org/>

A similar technique is used for solving both *Integer Programs* and *Constraint Programs*: the problem is successively divided into smaller subproblems (branching) that are solved recursively.

On the other hand, Integer Programming and Constraint Programming have different strengths:

- *Integer Programming* uses LP relaxations and cutting planes to provide strong dual bounds, while
- *Constraint Programming* can handle arbitrary (non-linear) constraints and uses propagation to tighten domains of variables.

SCIP is a framework for Constraint Integer Programming oriented towards the needs of mathematical programming experts who want to have total control of the solution process and access detailed information down to the guts of the solver. SCIP can also be used as a pure MIP and MINLP solver or as a framework for branch-cut-and-price.

SCIP is implemented as C callable library and provides C++ wrapper classes for user plugins. It can also be used as a standalone program to solve mixed integer linear and nonlinear programs given in various formats such as MPS, LP, flatzinc, CNF, OPB, WBO, PIP, etc. Furthermore, SCIP can directly read ZIMPL models.
